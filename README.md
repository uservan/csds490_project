## Project Overview:

The project goal is to create and evaulate various methods of enhancing images in low-light conditions.

Typically by default when an image is taken it stores the raw rgb values in the image. To the human eye our perception struggles to determine sublte differenes so objects that are geuniley a different color can easily get lost in a dark image. Using image processing and machine learning tools can help overcome human eye limitations and make images more presentable to humans.

This project would be used by various camera and smartphone manafucatures to add in the ability to take better low-light condition pictures thus making a better product and sales proposition.

The benefit will be the greater availability of cameras which take good quality images in low lighting conditions. 


## Problem Statement:

How to fix images taken in dark lighting conditions?

Examples from "Beyond Brightening Low-light Images"

The traditional approach is using histogram equalization. This typically is quite limited and works better on balancing out brightness rather than raising the brightness of an extremely dark image.

A more modern approach is to use a Generative Adversial Network (GAN) and train a network to brighten images. This approach can work quite well on training data but, can struggle to generalize to other images depending on the tuning and dataset chosen.

## Objectives:

Brighten up images taken in various degrees of darkness.
