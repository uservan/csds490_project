The traditional approach is using histogram equalization. This typically is quite limited and works better on balancing out brightness rather than raising the brightness of an extremely dark image.

A more modern approach is to use a Generative Adversial Network (GAN) and train a network to brighten images. This approach can work quite well on training data but, can struggle to generalize to other images depending on the tuning and dataset chosen.

## Objectives:

Brighten up images taken in various degrees of darkness.
